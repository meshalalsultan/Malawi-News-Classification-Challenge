# Malawi News Classification Challenge

## Overview
This project addresses the challenge of classifying news articles in Malawi using machine learning techniques. By analyzing text data, the model categorizes news articles into predefined classes, providing a tool for automated content sorting and analysis.

## Features
- **Text Classification**: Automatically classify news articles into various categories.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Project Structure
- **News_Africa.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning pipeline.
- **Train.csv**: Training dataset with labeled news articles.
- **Test.csv**: Test dataset for evaluating the model.
- **SampleSubmission.csv**: Example of the submission format.
- **spyder.py**: Python script for additional data analysis.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meshalalsultan/Malawi-News-Classification-Challenge.git
    ```
2. **Install required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # assuming this exists
    ```
3. **Explore the notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook News_Africa.ipynb
    ```

## How It Works
The project uses a machine learning model trained on labeled data from `Train.csv` to predict the categories of new articles in `Test.csv`. The process involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying classification algorithms.

## Contributing
